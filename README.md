# NeoGalaga

🚀 **NeoGalaga** is a futuristic reimagining of the classic arcade space shooter *Galaga*.  
Developed in Python using the [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/) library, this project serves as an educational demonstration of core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a complete 2D game using Python and Arcade
- Apply and demonstrate OOP fundamentals:
  - 🔒 Encapsulation
  - 🧬 Inheritance
  - 🎭 Polymorphism
  - 🧠 Abstraction
- Use modular and scalable code architecture
- Design a clean, futuristic aesthetic with modern effects

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Arcade Library](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/)
- Good practices in Object-Oriented Programming

- ✅ Player movement (left/right with arrow keys or A/D)

- ✅ Player can fire bullets using the spacebar

- ✅ Enemies appear in a basic top-row formation

- ✅ Bullets collide with enemies and remove them

- ✅ Score system implemented and displayed on screen

- ✅ Modular OOP structure using Arcade sprites

- ⚙️ In progress: enemy movement and behavior patterns

---

## ✨ Features to Be Added

- Multiple enemy types and attack behaviors

- Power-ups and special weapons

- Player lives / health system

- Sound effects and background music

- Level progression and difficulty scaling

- Main menu and game over screen

- Pause/resume functionality
