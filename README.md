# NeoGalaga

🚀 **NeoGalaga** is a futuristic reimagining of the classic arcade space shooter *Galaga*.  
Developed in Python using the [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/) library, this project serves as an educational demonstration of core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a complete 2D game using Python and Arcade
- Apply and demonstrate OOP fundamentals:
  - 🔒 Encapsulation
  - 🧬 Inheritance
  - 🎭 Polymorphism
  - 🧠 Abstraction
- Use modular and scalable code architecture
- Design a clean, futuristic aesthetic with modern effects

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Arcade Library](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/)
- Good practices in Object-Oriented Programming
